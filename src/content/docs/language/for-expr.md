## For Loops in GLuaX

GLuaX provides two main kinds of `for` loops: the numeric `for` loop and the `for-in` loop.

### Numeric For Loop

The numeric `for` loop is similar to Lua's and is used for iterating over a range of numbers. You can optionally specify a step value.

```gluax
// Basic for loop
for i = 1, 10 {
    // body, i from 1 to 10
}

// With a step
for i = 1, 10, 2 {
    // body, i from 1 to 10, step 2
}
```

### For-In Loop

The `for-in` loop is used to iterate over collections like maps, vectors, or any class that implements the required iteration functions.

```gluax
let m = map{
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
    "c": 3
};
for k, v in m {
    print(k, v);
}

let v = vec{1, 2, 3};
for i, val in v {
    print(i, val);
}
```

You can also loop through strings, where each iteration gives you the index and the character at that position:

```gluax
for i, ch in "hello" {
    print(i, ch);
}
// Output:
// 1 h
// 2 e
// 3 l
// 4 l
// 5 o
```

> **Note:**
> Although the generated code may look verbose or slow, it is actually very fast. All the output you see here consists of simple operations that LuaJIT handles extremely efficiently.

```lua
local __gluax_t_10, __gluax_t_12, __gluax_t_14, __gluax_t_15, __gluax_t_16;
do
    __gluax_t_10 = "hello";
    do -- inline __x_iter_range_bound
        local self = __gluax_t_10;
        __gluax_t_12 = (#self);
    end
    for i = 1, __gluax_t_12 do
        do -- inline __x_iter_range
            local self, idx = __gluax_t_10, i;
            __gluax_t_15 = self;
            __gluax_t_16 = idx;
            __gluax_t_14 = string.sub --[[str::sub]](__gluax_t_15, __gluax_t_16, idx);
        end
        local ch = __gluax_t_14;
        do
            do
                __gluax_t_16 = i;
                local _ = print(__gluax_t_16, ch);
            end
        end
        ::__gluax_continue_9::
    end
    ::__gluax_break_9::
end
```

#### Making Classes Iterable

You can make your own classes iterable in a `for-in` loop by implementing certain reserved functions. For example, when iterating over a `vec` using a `for-in` loop, it is compiled to a simple numeric loop (`for i = 1, #v do local v = #v[i] end`) for efficiency, instead of using `pairs` or `ipairs`. This is achieved by defining these functions:

```gluax
#[inline]
func __x_iter_range_bound(self) -> number { #self }

#[inline]
func __x_iter_range(self, idx: number) -> T {
    @raw("{@RETURN {@1@}[{@2@}] @}", self, idx) -> T
}
```

For maps, iteration is handled by:

```gluax
#[inline]
func __x_iter_pairs(self) -> (func(table, any) -> (K, V), Self) {
    (globals::base::next unsafe_cast_as func(table, any) -> (K, V), self)
}
```

By implementing these functions, any class can be made iterable in a `for-in` loop, allowing for efficient and flexible iteration patterns.

> **Note:**
> The way to define iterable functions for classes may change in the future. Itâ€™s possible that iteration could be handled using traits or another mechanism in later versions of GLuaX. This is still subject to change until the language reaches version 1.0.
